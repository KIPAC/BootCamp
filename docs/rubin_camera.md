# Computing Environment for Vera Rubin Observatory Camera Work

To analyze test data from the LSST camera you will need a set of
software tools known as the LSST Data Management (DM) stack, as well
as a few other tools.  These tools are largely set up for you already and are easy to activate.

## Jupyter Notebook Setup.

You can connect to the jupyter cluster by
pointing your web browser at this url:
[https://jupyter.slac.stanford.edu/](https://jupyter.slac.stanford.edu/)

The landing page will ask you which image you want to spawn.
To get started you probably want to select the "recommend" LSST image.

Then depending on what you want to do  the LSST software or just want to use a
python notebook you can run either the "LSST" or "python" kernels.


## Interactive shell setup.

Typically you will want to use the centos7 interactive cluster at
SLAC.  That cluster has access to the camera data and
the data analysis software.

See [this page](slac_computing.md) about setting up your computer to remotely 
log in to SLAC. 

Typically I do this by running this command from a terminal or xterm
window on Mac laptop.  

    $ ssh -tt -Y username@centos7.slac.stanford.edu

Note: the "$" represents the unix command prompt.

See [this page](windows_setup.md) for how to do that from windows.

One time only, edit the hidden configuration file '.bash_profile' in your home
directory to invoke the group configuration file.

You can invoke an editor like so (note: the "$" represents the unix
command prompt)::

    $ nano .bash_profile

You can find links to more information about various unix text editors
[here](text_editors.md)

You will want to add this line to your '.bash_profile' file.

    source /nfs/farm/g/lsst/u1/group_config/setup_dm_stack.bashrc

That will set you up with the same configuration the rest of the
camera data analysis group is using.

In particular that will define a command that sets the parts of the
LSST software environment that you will need.   You can invoke that
command like so:

    $ lsst_setup

At that point you can check that things are set up by asking the shell
which version of python is active:

    $ which python
    /cvmfs/sw.lsst.eu/linux-x86_64/lsst_distrib/w_2020_01/python/miniconda3-4.7.10/envs/lsst-scipipe-4d7b902/bin/python

You can also make sure that your python environment is working by doing
something like this:  (note, in this case the python command prompt is "> > >"):

    $ python
    Python 3.7.2 (default, Dec 29 2018, 06:19:36) 
    [GCC 7.3.0] :: Anaconda, Inc. on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 
    >>> import lsst
    >>> lsst.__file__
    '/cvmfs/sw.lsst.eu/linux-x86_64/lsst_distrib/w_2020_01/stack/miniconda3-4.7.10-4d7b902/Linux64/fgcmcal/19.0.0+17/python/lsst/__init__.py'

That just tells you where the LSST software is located.


### Accessing the Jupyter hub home area in the interactive shell.

You can access your jupyter hub home area in an interactive shell by
navigating to:

    cd /gpfs/slac/lsst/fs1/u/username
