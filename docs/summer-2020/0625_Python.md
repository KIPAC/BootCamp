# Python Basics

### Some comments

Based on the survey that you filled out, most of you have at 
least some experience with python, and some of you have quite a bit of of exprience.

I want to re-iterate the point I made Tuesday, that you are each other's best resource.

If you want to know how to do something, or why something isn't working, and you are stuck after a bit of trying, 
then ask your fellow students.

Conversely, even if you are quite proficient at something, you can still really improve your understand by teaching
it to others.  And it is always good to pratice explaining things clearly, that is really a core skill for scientists.


### Goals

This is mainly some demonstrations of some basic python code and functions, and some tools to find your way around in python.

### Resources and links


### Stuff to do ahead of time

Make sure that you can run jupyter notebooks on your computer.  

Make sure that you can start a terminal and run python from it.

### Activities and demos

Running [Basic python notebook](../../Python/Python%20(1).ipynb)

Running [python data structures notebook](../../Python/Python%20(1).ipynb)

Starting a terminal and running python in the terminal.

Running python scripts from a terminal.
