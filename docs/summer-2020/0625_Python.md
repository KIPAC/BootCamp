# Python Basics

### Some comments

Based on the survey that you filled out, most of you have at 
least some experience with python, and some of you have quite a bit of of exprience.

I want to re-iterate the point I made yesterday, that you are each other's best resource.

If you want to know how to do something, or why something isn't working, and you are stuck after a bit of trying, 
then ask your fellow students.

Conversely, even if you are quite proficient at something, you can still really improve your understand by teaching
it to others.  And it is always good to pratice explaining things clearly, that is really a core skill for scientists.
