# Setting up your computer to do research

### Goals

This is an interactive session to make sure that everyone at least has their computer set up to do a few basic things.  

We expect that many of you have already done this.  In that case you can help others to get set up.

### Resources and links

[Welcome page](../../README.md)

[MacOs setup page](../macos_setup.md)

[Windows setup page](../windows_setup.md)

### Stuff to do ahead of time

- Install Slack (if you don't have it already) and join the channels that your group will be using.  You might also want to join

  - [Students and mentors Slack Channel](https://KIPAC.slack.com/messages/summer-students-plus-mentors)

  - [Students only Slack Channel](https://KIPAC.slack.com/messages/summer-students)

- Follow either the Windows and Mac setup and install these three things on your personal computer:

   - conda (Either anaconda or miniconda) including python and jupyter 

   - terminal or terminal emulator program

   - graphics handler such as XQuartz or Cygwin
   
- Download or clone this project repository to your personal computer

    - Click on the "Clone or download" button on this page [https://github.com/KIPAC/BootCamp]  
    
    - If you are familiar with git you can clone the repository, otherwise select "Download zip".  You will want to unpack the zip fill into a place you can find it again easily.

### Activities and demos

- Running a jupyter notebook locally on your computer

- Running a jupyter notebook on an existing remote server

- Running a terminal window and connecting to a remote computer

- Starting a jupyter server remotely and connecting to it

- Time permitting, start covering basics of python
