# Computing Environment for LUX/LZ work

## LZ

If you are new to LZ, the first place to visit is the [LZ primer](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DOgM2hlBaTrMgyxoRPcqRaVp7wXi1FdD9YhTDxk9Cmo/edit#slide=id.p). 

Most US computing work is done at [NERSC](https://www.nersc.gov/). The first steps to getting started on LZ analysis are:
1. [Get a NERSC account](http://www.nersc.gov/users/accounts/user-accounts/get-a-nersc-account)
1. Get a [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) account and ask to be added to the LUX-ZEPLIN group (see primer for [details](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DOgM2hlBaTrMgyxoRPcqRaVp7wXi1FdD9YhTDxk9Cmo/edit#slide=id.g2781c5cc35_0_228))

LZ has extensive [software documentation](https://luxzeplin.gitlab.io/docs/softwaredocs/index.html) (accessible to LZ members only). All details for doing LZ analysis at NERSC can be found there.

## SLAC liquid nobles

The liquid nobles group at IR2 at SLAC also has some computing resources. Details can be found on the group's [confluence page](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=LZ&title=LZ+at+SLAC+Home).
