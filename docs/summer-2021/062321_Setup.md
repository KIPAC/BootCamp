# Setting up your computer to do research

### Goals

This is an interactive session to make sure that everyone at least has their computer set up to do a few basic things.  

We expect that many of you have already done this.  In that case you can help others to get set up.

### Resources and links

[Welcome page](../../README.md)

[MacOS setup page](../macos_setup.md)

[Windows setup page](../windows_setup.md)

[Chrome OS setup page](../chrome_os_setup.md)

### Stuff to do ahead of time

- Install Slack (if you don't have it already) and join the channels that your group will be using.  You might also want to join

  - [Students and mentors Slack Channel](https://KIPAC.slack.com/messages/summer-students-plus-mentors)

  - [Students only Slack Channel](https://KIPAC.slack.com/messages/summer-students)

- Follow either the Windows, Mac, or Chrome setup and install these three things on your personal computer:

   - conda (Either anaconda or miniconda) including python and jupyter 

   - terminal or terminal emulator program

   - graphics handler such as XQuartz or Cygwin
   
- Download or clone this project repository to your personal computer

    - Click on the "Clone or download" button on this page [https://github.com/KIPAC/BootCamp]  
    
    - If you are familiar with git you can clone the repository, otherwise select "Download zip".  You will want to unpack the zip file into a place you can find it again easily.

If you run into problems setting up any of these things, don't worry.  We've set aside some time today to work with people to get set up.

### Activities and demos

- Unix basics
-  Running a jupyter notebook locally on your computer

  - Using Anaconda
 
  - Using the Terminal and Miniconda

- Running a jupyter notebook on an existing remote server 

  - In this case the SLAC [jupyter hub](https://jupyter.slac.stanford.edu/)

- Running a terminal window and connecting to a remote computer

  - In a terminal window you can connect to the SLAC machines with the following command (if you have an account)
  
      ssh -YK USERNAME@centos7.slac.stanford.edu

- Starting a jupyter server remotely and connecting to it using the instructions [here](../jupyter_tunnel.md)
- Time permitting, start covering basics of python

# Unix Basics

### Goals

This is mainly some demonstrations of some basic unix.

### Resources and links

### Stuff to do ahead of time

Make sure that you can start a terminal on your computer.

### Activities and demos

Basic unix commands and environment, see [this notebook](../../Unix/Unix%20(1).ipynb)

Setting up your unix startup scripts, see [this notebook](../../Unix/Unix%20(2).ipynb)

# Python basics

### Stuff to do ahead of time

Make sure that you can run jupyter notebooks on your computer.  

Make sure that you can start a terminal and run python from it.

### Activities and demos
