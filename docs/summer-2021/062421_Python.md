# Python Basics

### Some comments

Many or most  of you have at least some experience with python, and some of you have quite a bit of of exprience. Throughout this bootcamp and this summer, an important thing to keep in mind is that  you are each other's best resource!

If you want to know how to do something, or why something isn't working, and you are stuck after a bit of trying, then ask your fellow students.

Conversely, even if you are quite proficient at something, you can still really improve your understand by teaching it to others.  And it is always good to pratice explaining things clearly, that is really a core skill for scientists.


### Goals

This is mainly some demonstrations of some basic python code and functions, and some tools to find your way around in python.

### Resources and links

There are a great many resources out there to start learning python.  Some of them are simple and clear, some are quite techinical.   I 
just recommend you do a web search and find one that works for you.

The [google tutorial](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) is a decent mix of technical and simple.  

### Stuff to do ahead of time

Make sure that you can run jupyter notebooks on your computer.  

Make sure that you can start a terminal and run python from it.

### Activities and demos

- Running [Basic python notebook](../../Python/Python%20(1).ipynb) (if we didn't get to this during the first session)

- Running [python data structures notebook](../../Python/Python%20(2).ipynb)

- Starting a terminal and running python in the terminal.

- Running python scripts from a terminal.

- Numerical python and matplotlib, see [this notebook](../../Python/Python%20(3).ipynb)

- (If time) Astropy, healpy, scikit-learn, see [this notebook](../../Python/Python%20(5).ipynb)
