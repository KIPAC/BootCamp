# Welcome to KIPAC

This page is intended to help you get started using our computing
resources to do research while you are at KIPAC.

There are several different projeces ongoing at KIPAC and each of them
has its own computing resources and environment.  However, we all do
share certain resources.

## Getting and setting up accounts

Depending on if you are working at SLAC or on campus (or both) you
will have computing accounts for either or both places.

[SLAC computing accounts](docs/slac_computing.md)

[Stanford coputing accounts](docs/stanford_computing.md)


## Setting up your computer 

Depending on the project you are working on, and the details of your
work, you may find that you do almost all or almost none of your work
on your own computer as opposed to on SLAC or Stanford computers.

However, at a minimum, you will almost certainly need to be able
to connect terminal and graphics to remote (i.e., SLAC / Stanford)
computers.   It is also very likely that you will need to be able to
run Jupyter analysis notebooks both on your computer, and by
connecting your computer to a notebook server running at slac.

[Windows](docs/windows_setup.md)

As usual, if you are using a linux computer you are on you own.
