# Unix Text Editors

Text editors are the tool that we use most often.   There are a very
large number of them out there.   You probably just want to pick one
that works for you and get used using it. 

The most widely used ones around KIPAC are:

[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and the popular MacOs
version [Aquamacs](http://aquamacs.org/).

[Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/)

[Vim](https://www.vim.org/)


Here are some posts that might help you decide which one to use:

It doesn't matter too much, though if you are just getting started you
might want pick one that other folks in your group are using, to make
it easier for them to help you.
