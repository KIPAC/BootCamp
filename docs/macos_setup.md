# Setting up a Mac computer to use for research

## Basic tools

You will need some way to manage files, connect to SLAC computers and
open display windows.  Generally that will be a combination of using
terminal windows and an X-windows systems for graphics.

### Terminal

The simplest command line environment on a mac is the built in terminal (Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal)

Here are a couple of simple guides for using terminals:

[MacPaw guide](https://macpaw.com/how-to/use-terminal-on-mac)

[Macworld guide](https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/how-use-terminal-on-mac-3608274)

You can explore those more later.  For now you just need to be able to
open an terminal 


### X Windows system (X-Quartz)

The X Windows system is a very common way to open connections to and send graphics from processes running on remote computers.   It is generically useful and
we recommend you install it if you are using a mac laptop.

### Text editor

You are going to need some way to edit files.   I strongly recommend
that you do not use "TextEdit" to try and edit software files.

There are many different options, here is a summary of some of your
choices:

## Other Tools

The tools that you are most likely to need on your personal computer
in order to do research "git", which is a file versioning system and
"conda", which is a combination of python and a software package management system.

### git

git is a versioning system that is pretty ubiquitous in our
work.  It lets many users work together to manage a large set of
files.  This can be set of software, or a paper draft, or some
documentation, or pretty much any kind of files. 

I recommend using the instructions under using "Install Git Using
Xcode" on the page below:

[Installation](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-git-on-mac)

[Documentation](https://xkcd.com/1597)

Running the following command in a terminal window will setup git and
use it to "clone" this BootCamp:

    # Install xcode and git if you have not already done so
    xcode-select --install
    # "Clone" this repository into a directory called "BootCamp" 
	git clone https://github.com/KIPAC/BootCamp.git

### Anaconda or Miniconda and Jupyter Notebooks

conda is a combination of python and a software package management
system.   You can either install the full anaconda package or your can
install miniconda, a minimal installer that bootstraps itself and only installs the package you need.

Note that the full anaconda distribution comes with a lot of tutorials
and extra things, so you might want to install that version.


#### Anaconda

You can download anaconda from here:

[anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/)

I recommend installing anaconda under '/Applications'.

Then you can do Applications -> Anaconda-Navigator

Then, in the "Home" tab of  Anaconda-Navigator you can select "Launch" 
in the "Notebook" app box.  This will start a local notebook servers
and open a web-browser window in your home directory.

##### Setting up anaconda for in a terminal window 

Once you have installed anaconda you can also set up your terminal
windows to activate conda for that terminal by doing this:

    # Activate conda
    . /Applications/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
    # "Activate" the "base" conda environment
	conda activate

(The lines that start with '#' are comments.)


#### Miniconda

You can download miniconda from there, (make sure to get the python 3 version):

[minconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

If you go the route of installing miniconda there are a number of packages, such as jupyter notebooks that you will likely need to install.

Running the following commands in a terminal window will install a minimal set of packages to
let you run jupyter notebooks locally. 

    # Activate conda, if you ran conda init when you installed
    # miniconda you don't need to do this
    . /Users/echarles/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh 
    # Create a conda environment to work these examples
    conda create --name kipac python
    # Install the stuff you need (from the conda-forge software 'channel')
    conda install --name kipac -c conda-forge numpy scipy jupyter
    # "Activate" the kipac environment
	conda activate kipac

(The lines that start with '#' are comments.)

### Running a notebook

f you want to start a notebook you can then do:

    # Start a notebook server in the current directory that you are in 
    jupyter notebook 

Once you have started a notebook server you will want to navigate to
the notebook that you want to run.  Let's start with the basic python
/ notebook tutorial.   In your browser you can selection that notebook
to open it.

BootCamp ->Python -> Python (1).ipynb

Note.   You can get you notebook browser to start up in
a different folder in a few different ways.   For example you could:

    # Version one, go to a directory and start the notebook server there
    cd ~/BootCamp/Python
	jupyter notebook
    # Version two, use the --notebook-dir option
    jupyter notebook --notebook-dir="BootCamp/Python"
