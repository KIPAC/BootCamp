### X Windows system (X-Quartz)

The X Windows system is a very common way to open connections to and send graphics from processes running on remote computers.   It is generically useful and
we recommend you install it if you are using a mac laptop.

## Local Tools

The tools that you are most likely to need on your personal computer in order to do research are anaconda,which is a combination of python and a software package management system and git, which is a software versioning system.

### Anaconda

Anaconda is a combination of python and a software package management system.   You can either install the full anaconda package or your can use install miniconda, a mininal installer that bootstraps itself and only installs the package you need.

### git

git is a software versioning system that is pretty ubiqitous in our work.
