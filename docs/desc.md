# Computing Enviroment for Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) Work

If you are new to DESC, you may want to visit the [DESC website](https://lsstdesc.org/) for general information.

DESC uses National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center [(NERSC) computing resources](nersc_computing.md). NERSC provides access to [Cori](https://www.nersc.gov/systems/cori/) as well as [JupyerLab](https://jupyter.nersc.gov) (login required) with a number of python environments available.

Working with your mentor you may become a student DESC member, which will grant you access to DESC's Confluence area.  An outline of using [NERSC for DESC is available here](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/LSSTDESC/Getting+Started+at+NERSC).

DESC developed software resides in our [GitHub area](http://github.com/LSSTDESC).
