    "## Introduction to Unix<a name=\"intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix refers to an operating system paradigm that has become the *de facto* standard in scientific computing, HPC, and software development. Unix was originally a single propriety operating system, but is now most prevalent in the form of distributions of operating systems based on the open source Linux kernel. In this tutorial, we focus on two central concepts of Unix: the filesystem and the shell. The Unix filesystem is summarized by the maxim [“Everything is a file”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file). In this filesystem everything from external hardware components to text files are organized in a single [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28data_structure%29).  The Unix shell is an interactive program (e.g. bash, csh, zsh, tcsh) that takes as input text commands written by a user, sends them to the operating system, and shows text output. "
