    "##### 1 Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible for an object to have multiple superclases. This is where the power of the `super` method really shows. It allows you to control which super method is called, if there is a conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2 Property\n",

    "\n",
    "You could define getter and setter methods, but the user can still access them via the `.` syntax. Instead, you should use [property!](http://www.programiz.com/python-programming/property) Property allows you to implement advanced assignment and access of of your object's methods.\n",

    "##### 4 Abstract Base Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of an abstract base class is unique to python. It is common to create a superclass the is not actually usable, as the user is intended to use the subclasses. The superclass just defines common shared functions, so as not to repeat code, and defines the structure for the subclasses. \n",
    "\n",
