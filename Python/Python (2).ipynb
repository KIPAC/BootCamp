    "## Part 6: Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are a very powerful and complex part of Python (and many other languages). We'll only touch on the basics today, but I encourage you to delve more deeply into them later! \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the basics. What *is* an object?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, first what *is* programming? \n",
    "\n",
    "Programming, in the most abstract sense, is defining logic to perform manipulations on data. It's a simulation of some operation, real or abstract. \n",
    "\n",
    "An object is an abstract... um... *object* that contains both its relevant data and functions to manipulate that data. It follows from the idea that what we really care about are these abstract objects than the logic or data separately. They are building blocks you can use to construct your programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ok sure but... what *is* an object?\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be a lot of things. It can represent something real, like a student or an astronomical object. It can represent something more abstract, like a statistical model or a cosmology. It could even be something completely abstract. For example, all the widgets and cells in this notebook are actually instances of objects within the Jupyter code. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming with objects allows you to design your programs the way you actually understand the logic yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make a simple class to get started. "
