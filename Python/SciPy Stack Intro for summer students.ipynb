    "\n",
    "The [SciPy Stack](https://scipy.org/index.html) is a set of Python software designed for scientific computing.\n",
    "Most scientific computing in Python heavily relies on SciPy Stack software, including\n",
    "- NumPy: numbers, vectors, arrays; implemented in C and Fortran so typically much faster than \"normal\" Python\n",
    "- pandas: data structures and tables (more accessible than \"raw\" NumPy arrays)\n",
    "- Matplotlib: plotting and visualization\n",
    "- SciPy: general functions for optimization, fitting, integration, signal processing, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most scientific computing in Python uses these libraries, so it's important (1) to have some basic familiarity with them, and (2) to know how and where to look for more information on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll try and distill some of basics of each of these packages and introduce you to how to *teach yourself* more.\n",
    "Each section will start with two links: (1) a more in-depth introductory tutorial for the software, and (2) the API reference for the software.\n",
    "We encourage you to look into those resources after you feel comfortable with the basics covered in this notebook."
