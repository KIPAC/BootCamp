# Version Control and Project Management with Git and GitHub

* Here's a [test repository](https://github.com/mclaughlin6464/GettingStarted) hosted at GitHub.com that you can *fork* and experiment with. It contains an FAQ about `git` and GitHub that hopefully you will find useful to refer to.

* Throughout this talk I will refer to a few Git commands, and I encourage to refer to the [Git cheat sheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) if you have questions.

* We will go through what `git` does, what GitHub provides and enables, and step through the process of getting set up to contribute to a project hosted on GitHub.

* You will need:
  * A GitHub account
  * The `git` program working on the command line. 

> `git` comes free with the Mac XCode package, for example. You can also learn how to install it for your operating system from the web.

* A video showing many parts of this tutorial can be found [on YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g9lsbJBPEs).

### Task: Improve Sean's "Getting Started with Git and GitHub" FAQ

* The FAQ in the [test repository](https://github.com/mclaughlin6464/GettingStarted) is being developed collaboratively as an open source project.

* Can you see something that needs fixing or improving? If so, [post an issue](https://github.com/mclaughlin6464/GettingStarted/issues)

* Can you fix it yourself, even partially? If so, then:

  * *fork* the repository,
  * *clone* it to your local machine,
  * edit the file(s) and *commit* your changes to make a new version,
  * then *push* those changes back to your fork - and then
  * ask for those improvements to be merged into the base repository by submitting a *pull request*.

  * You might even need to *add* a new file.
  * If you're making a lot of changes, perhaps they should be in a new *branch*.

* As the FAQ evolves, you'll want to keep up with the latest version.

  * Add a new *remote*, a link to the *base repository* and then
  * *pull* the changes down from that remote, and
  * fix any *conflicts* that arise.
 
* If you're interested in the project long term, you'll probably want to see what *epics* are in progress, and what the *milestones* are.
